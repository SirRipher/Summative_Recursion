# Summative_Recursion
It Finally works.


1. The difference in the Recursive code and the Iterative code is that the iterative code is longer and 
not put together the best, in the iterative code the lines after each other don't rely on what the line before was, the numbers are pre determined, and the iterative code will run 
until the play is set equal to false, the Recursive one will run untill all of the questions of how long the lines cshould be are all awnsered.

2. in the recursive code it will repeat the first 3 lines of code until the branchlen is smaller than ten, then it will start to do the side branches which awnser the questions in
the code causeing it to move on down the ist of code to awnser the next request, (in blue) and then it will go over the path again in red, and it will eventually skip an abundance
of the codebecause it has been awnsered already, it slowly awnsers all of the len 40, len 30, len 20, and len 10. Mine will check all of the if's and elifs to see which ones and
will go through with the ones which criteria it meats and will repeat this until it finally reaches the play = False to end the while loop at the start.

3.Recursion will continuouly ask questions that are awnsered by other questions untill it gets to the point where it haves one of the awnsers for the latest questions and then uses
the awnser that it found to awnser the previous questions going up to the first question. Iteratively will check all of the if's and while loops for things it is able to do, and 
will continue to check for ones it can do until it has reached something to kill the while loop.
